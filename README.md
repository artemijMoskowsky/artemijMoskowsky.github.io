### Storyline
The events of the game take place on a spaceship in the year 2452. 
The main character wakes up on the floor of the `[Data_Expunged]` hull, after which he heads for his only way to escape - an emergency evacuation ship.
What does he need to save himself from? 
You ask, and we will answer you - from assistant robots who have lost their minds, these bloodthirsty pieces of metal have already killed most of the ship, let's see how our hero stands up to this horror.
### Used Technologies
The following technologies were used in the project:
- HTML: Was the visualizer of our code, thanks to this you can see our project in all its glory.
- CSS: Used by us to conveniently add visual tweaks.
- JavaScript: Used to write all the logic of the project from pressing buttons to jumping the character.
### Graphics & Design
All images that you will see in our game were created by our hands, using Photoshop and a personal image editing program (for example, [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/)).
Thus, it turned out a graphically interesting game with a space theme.
### Game Code
The code of our game is structured, it has 15 modules, each of which plays its own special role.
The main problem that arose when writing the code was a large number of edits to the old code, every time we added something new, the old code immediately broke it, sometimes it seemed that it simply did not want to exist and deliberately broke itself.
### New Knowledge
While working on this project, we got to know the JavaScript language a little more, very often there were situations when it was necessary to learn something new for the implementation of this or that part of the project.
It was also another interesting experience of working in a team.
This will help us create more interesting projects with new, more developed technologies and knowledge.
